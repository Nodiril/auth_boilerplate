# auth_boilerplate

An attempt to create a more whole boilerplate of a user based application using:

 * VueJS
 * Vuex
 * ElementUI
 * Knexjs - Bookshelfjs - Posgresql
 * Apollo/Graphql
 
Instructions for client and server are in their respective folders.

## A few things that need to be addressed

- [ ] handle validations returned by server
- [ ] send jwt with each request and respond with data based on jwt
